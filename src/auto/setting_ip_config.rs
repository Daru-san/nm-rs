    ///
    ///
    /// #### `addresses`
    ///  Array of IP addresses.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `auto-route-ext-gw`
    ///  VPN connections will default to add the route automatically unless this
    /// setting is set to [`false`].
    ///
    /// For other connection types, adding such an automatic route is currently
    /// not supported and setting this to [`true`] has no effect.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dad-timeout`
    ///  Maximum timeout in milliseconds used to check for the presence of duplicate
    /// IP addresses on the network.  If an address conflict is detected, the
    /// activation will fail. The property is currently implemented only for IPv4.
    ///
    /// A zero value means that no duplicate address detection is performed, -1 means
    /// the default value (either the value configured globally in NetworkManger.conf
    /// or 200ms).  A value greater than zero is a timeout in milliseconds.  Note that
    /// the time intervals are subject to randomization as per RFC 5227 and so the
    /// actual duration can be between half and the full time specified in this
    /// property.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-dscp`
    ///  Specifies the value for the DSCP field (traffic class) of the IP header. When
    /// empty, the global default value is used; if no global default is specified, it is
    /// assumed to be "CS0". Allowed values are: "CS0", "CS4" and "CS6".
    ///
    /// The property is currently valid only for IPv4, and it is supported only by the
    /// "internal" DHCP plugin.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-hostname`
    ///  If the #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname property is [`true`], then the
    /// specified name will be sent to the DHCP server when acquiring a lease.
    /// This property and #NMSettingIP4Config:dhcp-fqdn are mutually exclusive and
    /// cannot be set at the same time.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-hostname-flags`
    ///  Flags for the DHCP hostname and FQDN.
    ///
    /// Currently, this property only includes flags to control the FQDN flags
    /// set in the DHCP FQDN option. Supported FQDN flags are
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE],
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_ENCODED`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_ENCODED] and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_NO_UPDATE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_NO_UPDATE].  When no FQDN flag is set and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS] is set, the DHCP FQDN option will
    /// contain no flag. Otherwise, if no FQDN flag is set and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS] is not set, the standard FQDN flags

    /// described above are sent in the DHCP requests.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-iaid`
    ///  A string containing the "Identity Association Identifier" (IAID) used by
    /// the DHCP client. The string can be a 32-bit number (either decimal,
    /// hexadecimal or as colon separated hexadecimal numbers). Alternatively
    /// it can be set to the special values "mac", "perm-mac", "ifname" or
    /// "stable". When set to "mac" (or "perm-mac"), the last 4 bytes of the
    /// current (or permanent) MAC address are used as IAID. When set to
    /// "ifname", the IAID is computed by hashing the interface name. The
    /// special value "stable" can be used to generate an IAID based on the
    /// stable-id (see connection.stable-id), a per-host key and the interface
    /// name. When the property is unset, the value from global configuration is
    /// used; if no global default is set then the IAID is assumed to be
    /// "ifname".
    ///
    /// For DHCPv4, the IAID is only used with "ipv4.dhcp-client-id"
    /// values "duid" and "ipv6-duid" to generate the client-id.
    ///
    /// For DHCPv6, note that at the moment this property is
    /// only supported by the "internal" DHCPv6 plugin. The "dhclient" DHCPv6
    /// plugin always derives the IAID from the MAC address.
    ///
    /// The actually used DHCPv6 IAID for a currently activated interface is
    /// exposed in the lease information of the device.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-reject-servers`
    ///  Array of servers from which DHCP offers must be rejected. This property
    /// is useful to avoid getting a lease from misconfigured or rogue servers.
    ///
    /// For DHCPv4, each element must be an IPv4 address, optionally
    /// followed by a slash and a prefix length (e.g. "192.168.122.0/24").
    ///
    /// This property is currently not implemented for DHCPv6.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-hostname`
    ///  Since 1.52 this property is deprecated and is only used as fallback value
    /// for #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname-v2 if it's set to 'default'.
    /// This is only done to avoid breaking existing configurations, the new
    /// property should be used from now on.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-hostname-v2`
    ///  If [`true`], a hostname is sent to the DHCP server when acquiring a lease.
    /// Some DHCP servers use this hostname to update DNS databases, essentially
    /// providing a static hostname for the computer.  If the
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-hostname property is [`None`] and this property is
    /// [`true`], the current persistent hostname of the computer is sent.
    ///
    /// The default value is [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default]. In this case the global value
    /// from NetworkManager configuration is looked up. If it's not set, the value
    /// from #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname, which defaults to [`true`], is
    /// used for backwards compatibility. In the future this will change and, in
    /// absence of a global default, it will always fallback to [`true`].
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-release`
    ///  Whether the DHCP client will send RELEASE message when
    /// bringing the connection down. The default value is [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default].
    /// When the default value is specified, then the global value from NetworkManager
    /// configuration is looked up, if not set, it is considered as [`false`].
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-timeout`
    ///  A timeout for a DHCP transaction in seconds. If zero (the default), a
    /// globally configured default is used. If still unspecified, a device specific
    /// timeout is used (usually 45 seconds).
    ///
    /// Set to 2147483647 (MAXINT32) for infinity.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns`
    ///  Array of DNS servers.
    ///
    /// Each server can be specified either as a plain IP address (optionally followed
    /// by a "#" and the SNI server name for DNS over TLS) or with a URI syntax.
    ///
    /// When it is specified as an URI, the following forms are supported:
    /// dns+udp://ADDRESS[:PORT], dns+tls://ADDRESS[:PORT][#SERVERNAME] .
    ///
    /// When using the URI syntax, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square
    /// brackets ('[', ']').
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-options`
    ///  Array of DNS options to be added to resolv.conf.
    ///
    /// [`None`] means that the options are unset and left at the default.
    /// In this case NetworkManager will use default options. This is
    /// distinct from an empty list of properties.
    ///
    /// The following options are directly added to resolv.conf: "attempts",
    ///  "debug", "edns0",
    /// "inet6", "ip6-bytestring", "ip6-dotint", "ndots", "no-aaaa",
    /// "no-check-names", "no-ip6-dotint", "no-reload", "no-tld-query",
    /// "rotate", "single-request", "single-request-reopen", "timeout",
    /// "trust-ad", "use-vc". See the resolv.conf(5) man page for a
    /// detailed description of these options.
    ///
    /// In addition, NetworkManager supports the special options "_no-add-edns0"
    /// and "_no-add-trust-ad". They are not added to resolv.conf, and can be
    /// used to prevent the automatic addition of options "edns0" and "trust-ad"
    /// when using caching DNS plugins (see below).
    ///
    /// The "trust-ad" setting is only honored if the profile contributes
    /// name servers to resolv.conf, and if all contributing profiles have
    /// "trust-ad" enabled.
    ///
    /// When using a caching DNS plugin (dnsmasq or systemd-resolved in
    /// NetworkManager.conf) then "edns0" and "trust-ad" are automatically
    /// added, unless "_no-add-edns0" and "_no-add-trust-ad" are present.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-priority`
    ///  DNS servers priority.
    ///
    /// The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting.  A lower
    /// numerical value is better (higher priority).
    ///
    /// Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations
    /// with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative
    /// priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used.
    /// To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used
    /// to the most negative value of all active connections profiles.
    ///
    /// Zero selects a globally configured default value. If the latter is missing
    /// or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for
    /// other connections.
    ///
    /// Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active
    /// connections.  It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the
    /// same connection profile.
    ///
    /// When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be
    /// considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default
    /// route and then all other devices.
    ///
    /// When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of
    /// resolv.conf. To prioritize a given server over another one within the
    /// same connection, just specify them in the desired order.
    /// Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv.conf
    /// in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list
    /// on failure. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns-options setting.
    /// If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from
    /// the devices with that lowest priority will be considered.
    ///
    /// When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or
    /// Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved settings), each connection
    /// is used to query domains in its search list. The search domains determine which
    /// name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize
    /// name servers based on the domain.  Queries for domains not present in any
    /// search list are routed through connections having the '~.' special wildcard
    /// domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route
    /// (or can be added manually).  When multiple connections specify the same domain, the
    /// one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins.  If a sub domain
    /// is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority,
    /// unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes
    /// the sub domain to be shadowed.
    /// With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring
    /// DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired
    /// interface are configured.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-search`
    ///  List of DNS search domains. Domains starting with a tilde ('~')
    /// are considered 'routing' domains and are used only to decide the
    /// interface over which a query must be forwarded; they are not used
    /// to complete unqualified host names.
    ///
    /// When using a DNS plugin that supports Conditional Forwarding or
    /// Split DNS, then the search domains specify which name servers to
    /// query. This makes the behavior different from running with plain
    /// /etc/resolv.conf. For more information see also the dns-priority setting.
    ///
    /// When set on a profile that also enabled DHCP, the DNS search list
    /// received automatically (option 119 for DHCPv4 and option 24 for DHCPv6)
    /// gets merged with the manual list. This can be prevented by setting
    /// "ignore-auto-dns". Note that if no DNS searches are configured, the
    /// fallback will be derived from the domain from DHCP (option 15).
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `forwarding`
    ///  Whether to configure sysctl interface-specific forwarding. When enabled, the interface
    /// will act as a router to forward the packet from one interface to another. When set to
    /// [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default], the value from global configuration is used;
    /// if no global default is defined, [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Auto`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Auto] will be used.
    /// The #NMSettingIPConfig:forwarding property is ignored when #NMSettingIPConfig:method
    /// is set to "shared", because forwarding is always enabled in this case.
    /// The accepted values are:
    ///   [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default]: use global default.
    ///   [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::No`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::No]: disabled.
    ///   [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Yes`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Yes]: enabled.
    ///   [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Auto`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Auto]: enable if any shared connection is active,
    ///        use kernel default otherwise.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `gateway`
    ///  The gateway associated with this configuration. This is only meaningful
    /// if #NMSettingIPConfig:addresses is also set.
    ///
    /// Setting the gateway causes NetworkManager to configure a standard default route
    /// with the gateway as next hop. This is ignored if #NMSettingIPConfig:never-default
    /// is set. An alternative is to configure the default route explicitly with a manual
    /// route and /0 as prefix length.
    ///
    /// Note that the gateway usually conflicts with routing that NetworkManager configures
    /// for WireGuard interfaces, so usually it should not be set in that case. See
    /// #NMSettingWireGuard:ip4-auto-default-route.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `ignore-auto-dns`
    ///  When #NMSettingIPConfig:method is set to "auto" and this property to
    /// [`true`], automatically configured name servers and search domains are
    /// ignored and only name servers and search domains specified in the
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:dns and #NMSettingIPConfig:dns-search properties, if
    /// any, are used.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `ignore-auto-routes`
    ///  When #NMSettingIPConfig:method is set to "auto" and this property to
    /// [`true`], automatically configured routes are ignored and only routes
    /// specified in the #NMSettingIPConfig:routes property, if any, are used.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `may-fail`
    ///  If [`true`], allow overall network configuration to proceed even if the
    /// configuration specified by this property times out.  Note that at least
    /// one IP configuration must succeed or overall network configuration will
    /// still fail.  For example, in IPv6-only networks, setting this property to
    /// [`true`] on the #NMSettingIP4Config allows the overall network configuration
    /// to succeed if IPv4 configuration fails but IPv6 configuration completes
    /// successfully.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `method`
    ///  IP configuration method.
    ///
    /// #NMSettingIP4Config and #NMSettingIP6Config both support "disabled",
    /// "auto", "manual", and "link-local". See the subclass-specific
    /// documentation for other values.
    ///
    /// In general, for the "auto" method, properties such as
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:dns and #NMSettingIPConfig:routes specify information
    /// that is added on to the information returned from automatic
    /// configuration.  The #NMSettingIPConfig:ignore-auto-routes and
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:ignore-auto-dns properties modify this behavior.
    ///
    /// For methods that imply no upstream network, such as "shared" or
    /// "link-local", these properties must be empty.
    ///
    /// For IPv4 method "shared", the IP subnet can be configured by adding one
    /// manual IPv4 address or otherwise 10.42.x.0/24 is chosen. Note that the
    /// shared method must be configured on the interface which shares the internet
    /// to a subnet, not on the uplink which is shared.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `never-default`
    ///  If [`true`], this connection will never be the default connection for this
    /// IP type, meaning it will never be assigned the default route by
    /// NetworkManager.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `replace-local-rule`
    ///  Connections will default to keep the autogenerated priority 0 local rule
    /// unless this setting is set to [`true`].
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `required-timeout`
    ///  The minimum time interval in milliseconds for which dynamic IP configuration
    /// should be tried before the connection succeeds.
    ///
    /// This property is useful for example if both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled and
    /// are allowed to fail. Normally the connection succeeds as soon as one of
    /// the two address families completes; by setting a required timeout for
    /// e.g. IPv4, one can ensure that even if IP6 succeeds earlier than IPv4,
    /// NetworkManager waits some time for IPv4 before the connection becomes
    /// active.
    ///
    /// Note that if #NMSettingIPConfig:may-fail is FALSE for the same address
    /// family, this property has no effect as NetworkManager needs to wait for
    /// the full DHCP timeout.
    ///
    /// A zero value means that no required timeout is present, -1 means the
    /// default value (either configuration ipvx.required-timeout override or
    /// zero).
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `route-metric`
    ///  The default metric for routes that don't explicitly specify a metric.
    /// The default value -1 means that the metric is chosen automatically
    /// based on the device type.
    /// The metric applies to dynamic routes, manual (static) routes that
    /// don't have an explicit metric setting, address prefix routes, and
    /// the default route.
    /// Note that for IPv6, the kernel accepts zero (0) but coerces it to
    /// 1024 (user default). Hence, setting this property to zero effectively
    /// mean setting it to 1024.
    /// For IPv4, zero is a regular value for the metric.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `route-table`
    ///  Enable policy routing (source routing) and set the routing table used when adding routes.
    ///
    /// This affects all routes, including device-routes, IPv4LL, DHCP, SLAAC, default-routes
    /// and static routes. But note that static routes can individually overwrite the setting
    /// by explicitly specifying a non-zero routing table.
    ///
    /// If the table setting is left at zero, it is eligible to be overwritten via global
    /// configuration. If the property is zero even after applying the global configuration
    /// value, policy routing is disabled for the address family of this connection.
    ///
    /// Policy routing disabled means that NetworkManager will add all routes to the main
    /// table (except static routes that explicitly configure a different table). Additionally,
    /// NetworkManager will not delete any extraneous routes from tables except the main table.
    /// This is to preserve backward compatibility for users who manage routing tables outside
    /// of NetworkManager.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `routed-dns`
    ///  Whether to add routes for DNS servers. When enabled, NetworkManager adds a route
    /// for each DNS server that is associated with this connection either statically
    /// (defined in the connection profile) or dynamically (for example, retrieved via
    /// DHCP). The route guarantees that the DNS server is reached via this interface. When

    /// The range should be part of network set by ipv4.address option and it should
