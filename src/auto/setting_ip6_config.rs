    /// ## Properties
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `addr-gen-mode`
    ///  Configure the method for creating the IPv6 interface identifier of
    /// addresses for RFC4862 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and IPv6
    /// Link Local.
    ///
    /// The permitted values are: [`SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::Eui64`][crate::SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::Eui64],
    /// [`SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::StablePrivacy`][crate::SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::StablePrivacy].
    /// [`SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::DefaultOrEui64`][crate::SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::DefaultOrEui64] or
    /// [`SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::Default`][crate::SettingIP6ConfigAddrGenMode::Default].
    ///
    /// If the property is set to "eui64", the addresses will be generated using
    /// the interface token derived from the hardware address. This makes the
    /// host part of the address constant, making it possible to track the
    /// host's presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the
    /// interface hardware is replaced. If a duplicate address is detected,
    /// there is no fallback to generate another address. When configured, the
    /// "ipv6.token" is used instead of the MAC address to generate addresses
    /// for stateless autoconfiguration.
    ///
    /// If the property is set to "stable-privacy", the interface identifier is
    /// generated as specified by RFC7217. This works by hashing a host specific
    /// key (see NetworkManager(8) manual), the interface name, the connection's
    /// "connection.stable-id" property and the address prefix.  This improves
    /// privacy by making it harder to use the address to track the host's
    /// presence as every prefix and network has a different identifier. Also,
    /// the address is stable when the network interface hardware is replaced.
    ///
    /// The special values "default" and "default-or-eui64" will fallback to the
    /// global connection default as documented in the NetworkManager.conf(5)
    /// manual. If the global default is not specified, the fallback value is
    /// "stable-privacy" or "eui64", respectively.
    ///
    /// For libnm, the property defaults to "default" since 1.40.  Previously it
    /// used to default to "stable-privacy".  On D-Bus, the absence of an
    /// addr-gen-mode setting equals "default". For keyfile plugin, the absence
    /// of the setting on disk means "default-or-eui64" so that the property
    /// doesn't change on upgrade from older versions.
    ///
    /// Note that this setting is distinct from the Privacy Extensions as
    /// configured by "ip6-privacy" property and it does not affect the
    /// temporary addresses configured with this option.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-duid`
    ///  A string containing the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier (DUID) used by the dhcp
    /// client to identify itself to DHCPv6 servers (RFC 3315). The DUID is carried
    /// in the Client Identifier option.
    /// If the property is a hex string ('aa:bb:cc') it is interpreted as a binary
    /// DUID and filled as an opaque value in the Client Identifier option.
    ///
    /// The special value "lease" will retrieve the DUID previously used from the
    /// lease file belonging to the connection. If no DUID is found and "dhclient"
    /// is the configured dhcp client, the DUID is searched in the system-wide
    /// dhclient lease file. If still no DUID is found, or another dhcp client is
    /// used, a global and permanent DUID-UUID (RFC 6355) will be generated based
    /// on the machine-id.
    ///
    /// The special values "llt" and "ll" will generate a DUID of type LLT or LL
    /// (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device. In order to
    /// try providing a stable DUID-LLT, the time field will contain a constant
    /// timestamp that is used globally (for all profiles) and persisted to disk.
    ///
    /// The special values "stable-llt", "stable-ll" and "stable-uuid" will generate
    /// a DUID of the corresponding type, derived from the connection's stable-id and
    /// a per-host unique key. You may want to include the "${DEVICE}" or "${MAC}" specifier
    /// in the stable-id, in case this profile gets activated on multiple devices.
    /// So, the link-layer address of "stable-ll" and "stable-llt" will be a generated
    /// address derived from the stable id. The DUID-LLT time value in the "stable-llt"
    /// option will be picked among a static timespan of three years (the upper bound
    /// of the interval is the same constant timestamp used in "llt").
    ///
    /// When the property is unset, the global value provided for "ipv6.dhcp-duid" is
    /// used. If no global value is provided, the default "lease" value is assumed.

    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-pd-hint`
    ///  A IPv6 address followed by a slash and a prefix length. If set, the value is
    /// sent to the DHCPv6 server as hint indicating the prefix delegation (IA_PD) we
    /// want to receive.
    /// To only hint a prefix length without prefix, set the address part to the
    /// zero address (for example "::/60").

    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `ip6-privacy`
    ///  Configure IPv6 Privacy Extensions for SLAAC, described in RFC4941.  If
    /// enabled, it makes the kernel generate a temporary IPv6 address in
    /// addition to the public one generated from MAC address via modified
    /// EUI-64.  This enhances privacy, but could cause problems in some
    /// applications, on the other hand.  The permitted values are: -1: unknown,
    /// 0: disabled, 1: enabled (prefer public address), 2: enabled (prefer temporary
    /// addresses).
    ///
    /// Having a per-connection setting set to "-1" (default) means fallback to
    /// global configuration "ipv6.ip6-privacy". If it's also unspecified or set
    /// to "-1", fallback to read "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/use_tempaddr".
    ///
    /// Note that this setting is distinct from the Stable Privacy addresses

    /// setting as another way of avoiding host tracking with IPv6 addresses.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `mtu`
    ///  Maximum transmission unit size, in bytes. If zero (the default), the MTU
    /// is set automatically from router advertisements or is left equal to the
    /// link-layer MTU. If greater than the link-layer MTU, or greater than zero
    /// but less than the minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280, this value has no effect.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `ra-timeout`
    ///  A timeout for waiting Router Advertisements in seconds. If zero (the default), a
    /// globally configured default is used. If still unspecified, the timeout depends on the
    /// sysctl settings of the device.
    ///
    /// Set to 2147483647 (MAXINT32) for infinity.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `temp-preferred-lifetime`
    ///  The preferred lifetime of autogenerated temporary addresses, in seconds.
    ///
    /// Having a per-connection setting set to "0" (default) means fallback to
    /// global configuration "ipv6.temp-preferred-lifetime" setting". If it's also

    /// IPv6 tokenized interface identifiers. Useful with eui64 addr-gen-mode.
    ///
    /// When set, the token is used as IPv6 interface identifier instead of the

    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    /// <details><summary><h4>SettingIPConfig</h4></summary>

    ///
    /// #### `auto-route-ext-gw`
    ///  VPN connections will default to add the route automatically unless this

    /// #### `dad-timeout`
    ///  Maximum timeout in milliseconds used to check for the presence of duplicate
    /// IP addresses on the network.  If an address conflict is detected, the
    /// activation will fail. The property is currently implemented only for IPv4.
    ///
    /// A zero value means that no duplicate address detection is performed, -1 means
    /// the default value (either the value configured globally in NetworkManger.conf
    /// or 200ms).  A value greater than zero is a timeout in milliseconds.  Note that
    /// the time intervals are subject to randomization as per RFC 5227 and so the
    /// actual duration can be between half and the full time specified in this
    /// property.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-dscp`
    ///  Specifies the value for the DSCP field (traffic class) of the IP header. When
    /// empty, the global default value is used; if no global default is specified, it is
    /// assumed to be "CS0". Allowed values are: "CS0", "CS4" and "CS6".
    ///
    /// The property is currently valid only for IPv4, and it is supported only by the
    /// "internal" DHCP plugin.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-hostname`
    ///  If the #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname property is [`true`], then the

    /// cannot be set at the same time.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-hostname-flags`
    ///  Flags for the DHCP hostname and FQDN.
    ///
    /// Currently, this property only includes flags to control the FQDN flags
    /// set in the DHCP FQDN option. Supported FQDN flags are
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE],
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_ENCODED`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_ENCODED] and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_NO_UPDATE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_NO_UPDATE].  When no FQDN flag is set and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS] is set, the DHCP FQDN option will
    /// contain no flag. Otherwise, if no FQDN flag is set and
    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS] is not set, the standard FQDN flags

    /// [`DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::FQDN_SERV_UPDATE] for IPv6.
    ///
    /// When this property is set to the default value [`DhcpHostnameFlags::NONE`][crate::DhcpHostnameFlags::NONE],
    /// a global default is looked up in NetworkManager configuration. If that value

    /// described above are sent in the DHCP requests.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-iaid`
    ///  A string containing the "Identity Association Identifier" (IAID) used by
    /// the DHCP client. The string can be a 32-bit number (either decimal,
    /// hexadecimal or as colon separated hexadecimal numbers). Alternatively
    /// it can be set to the special values "mac", "perm-mac", "ifname" or
    /// "stable". When set to "mac" (or "perm-mac"), the last 4 bytes of the
    /// current (or permanent) MAC address are used as IAID. When set to
    /// "ifname", the IAID is computed by hashing the interface name. The
    /// special value "stable" can be used to generate an IAID based on the
    /// stable-id (see connection.stable-id), a per-host key and the interface
    /// name. When the property is unset, the value from global configuration is
    /// used; if no global default is set then the IAID is assumed to be
    /// "ifname".
    ///
    /// For DHCPv4, the IAID is only used with "ipv4.dhcp-client-id"
    /// values "duid" and "ipv6-duid" to generate the client-id.
    ///
    /// For DHCPv6, note that at the moment this property is
    /// only supported by the "internal" DHCPv6 plugin. The "dhclient" DHCPv6
    /// plugin always derives the IAID from the MAC address.
    ///
    /// The actually used DHCPv6 IAID for a currently activated interface is
    /// exposed in the lease information of the device.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-reject-servers`
    ///  Array of servers from which DHCP offers must be rejected. This property
    /// is useful to avoid getting a lease from misconfigured or rogue servers.
    ///
    /// For DHCPv4, each element must be an IPv4 address, optionally
    /// followed by a slash and a prefix length (e.g. "192.168.122.0/24").
    ///
    /// This property is currently not implemented for DHCPv6.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-hostname`
    ///  Since 1.52 this property is deprecated and is only used as fallback value
    /// for #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname-v2 if it's set to 'default'.
    /// This is only done to avoid breaking existing configurations, the new
    /// property should be used from now on.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-hostname-v2`
    ///  If [`true`], a hostname is sent to the DHCP server when acquiring a lease.
    /// Some DHCP servers use this hostname to update DNS databases, essentially
    /// providing a static hostname for the computer.  If the
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-hostname property is [`None`] and this property is
    /// [`true`], the current persistent hostname of the computer is sent.
    ///
    /// The default value is [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default]. In this case the global value
    /// from NetworkManager configuration is looked up. If it's not set, the value
    /// from #NMSettingIPConfig:dhcp-send-hostname, which defaults to [`true`], is
    /// used for backwards compatibility. In the future this will change and, in
    /// absence of a global default, it will always fallback to [`true`].
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-send-release`
    ///  Whether the DHCP client will send RELEASE message when
    /// bringing the connection down. The default value is [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default].
    /// When the default value is specified, then the global value from NetworkManager

    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dhcp-timeout`
    ///  A timeout for a DHCP transaction in seconds. If zero (the default), a
    /// globally configured default is used. If still unspecified, a device specific
    /// timeout is used (usually 45 seconds).

    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns`
    ///  Array of DNS servers.
    ///
    /// Each server can be specified either as a plain IP address (optionally followed
    /// by a "#" and the SNI server name for DNS over TLS) or with a URI syntax.
    ///
    /// When it is specified as an URI, the following forms are supported:
    /// dns+udp://ADDRESS[:PORT], dns+tls://ADDRESS[:PORT][#SERVERNAME] .
    ///
    /// When using the URI syntax, IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square
    /// brackets ('[', ']').
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-options`
    ///  Array of DNS options to be added to resolv.conf.
    ///
    /// [`None`] means that the options are unset and left at the default.
    /// In this case NetworkManager will use default options. This is
    /// distinct from an empty list of properties.
    ///
    /// The following options are directly added to resolv.conf: "attempts",
    ///  "debug", "edns0",
    /// "inet6", "ip6-bytestring", "ip6-dotint", "ndots", "no-aaaa",
    /// "no-check-names", "no-ip6-dotint", "no-reload", "no-tld-query",
    /// "rotate", "single-request", "single-request-reopen", "timeout",
    /// "trust-ad", "use-vc". See the resolv.conf(5) man page for a
    /// detailed description of these options.
    ///
    /// In addition, NetworkManager supports the special options "_no-add-edns0"
    /// and "_no-add-trust-ad". They are not added to resolv.conf, and can be
    /// used to prevent the automatic addition of options "edns0" and "trust-ad"
    /// when using caching DNS plugins (see below).
    ///
    /// The "trust-ad" setting is only honored if the profile contributes
    /// name servers to resolv.conf, and if all contributing profiles have
    /// "trust-ad" enabled.
    ///
    /// When using a caching DNS plugin (dnsmasq or systemd-resolved in
    /// NetworkManager.conf) then "edns0" and "trust-ad" are automatically
    /// added, unless "_no-add-edns0" and "_no-add-trust-ad" are present.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-priority`
    ///  DNS servers priority.
    ///
    /// The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting.  A lower
    /// numerical value is better (higher priority).
    ///
    /// Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations
    /// with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative
    /// priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used.
    /// To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used
    /// to the most negative value of all active connections profiles.
    ///
    /// Zero selects a globally configured default value. If the latter is missing
    /// or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for
    /// other connections.
    ///
    /// Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active
    /// connections.  It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the
    /// same connection profile.
    ///
    /// When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be
    /// considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default
    /// route and then all other devices.
    ///
    /// When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of
    /// resolv.conf. To prioritize a given server over another one within the
    /// same connection, just specify them in the desired order.
    /// Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv.conf
    /// in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list
    /// on failure. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns-options setting.
    /// If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from
    /// the devices with that lowest priority will be considered.
    ///
    /// When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or
    /// Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd-resolved settings), each connection
    /// is used to query domains in its search list. The search domains determine which
    /// name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize
    /// name servers based on the domain.  Queries for domains not present in any
    /// search list are routed through connections having the '~.' special wildcard
    /// domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route
    /// (or can be added manually).  When multiple connections specify the same domain, the
    /// one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins.  If a sub domain
    /// is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority,
    /// unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes
    /// the sub domain to be shadowed.
    /// With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring
    /// DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired
    /// interface are configured.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `dns-search`
    ///  List of DNS search domains. Domains starting with a tilde ('~')
    /// are considered 'routing' domains and are used only to decide the
    /// interface over which a query must be forwarded; they are not used
    /// to complete unqualified host names.
    ///
    /// When using a DNS plugin that supports Conditional Forwarding or
    /// Split DNS, then the search domains specify which name servers to
    /// query. This makes the behavior different from running with plain
    /// /etc/resolv.conf. For more information see also the dns-priority setting.
    ///
    /// When set on a profile that also enabled DHCP, the DNS search list
    /// received automatically (option 119 for DHCPv4 and option 24 for DHCPv6)
    /// gets merged with the manual list. This can be prevented by setting
    /// "ignore-auto-dns". Note that if no DNS searches are configured, the
    /// fallback will be derived from the domain from DHCP (option 15).
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable

    ///
    /// #### `forwarding`
    ///  Whether to configure sysctl interface-specific forwarding. When enabled, the interface
    /// will act as a router to forward the packet from one interface to another. When set to
    /// [`SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default`][crate::SettingIPConfigForwarding::Default], the value from global configuration is used;

    /// one IP configuration must succeed or overall network configuration will
    /// still fail.  For example, in IPv6-only networks, setting this property to

    /// #NMSettingIP4Config and #NMSettingIP6Config both support "disabled",

    /// documentation for other values.
    ///
    /// In general, for the "auto" method, properties such as
    /// #NMSettingIPConfig:dns and #NMSettingIPConfig:routes specify information
    /// that is added on to the information returned from automatic
    /// configuration.  The #NMSettingIPConfig:ignore-auto-routes and

    ///
    /// For methods that imply no upstream network, such as "shared" or
    /// "link-local", these properties must be empty.
    ///
    /// For IPv4 method "shared", the IP subnet can be configured by adding one
    /// manual IPv4 address or otherwise 10.42.x.0/24 is chosen. Note that the
    /// shared method must be configured on the interface which shares the internet

    ///
    /// This property is useful for example if both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled and
    /// are allowed to fail. Normally the connection succeeds as soon as one of
    /// the two address families completes; by setting a required timeout for
    /// e.g. IPv4, one can ensure that even if IP6 succeeds earlier than IPv4,
    /// NetworkManager waits some time for IPv4 before the connection becomes
    /// active.
    ///
    /// Note that if #NMSettingIPConfig:may-fail is FALSE for the same address
    /// family, this property has no effect as NetworkManager needs to wait for
    /// the full DHCP timeout.

    /// Note that for IPv6, the kernel accepts zero (0) but coerces it to
    /// 1024 (user default). Hence, setting this property to zero effectively
    /// mean setting it to 1024.
    /// For IPv4, zero is a regular value for the metric.

    /// If the table setting is left at zero, it is eligible to be overwritten via global
    /// configuration. If the property is zero even after applying the global configuration
    /// value, policy routing is disabled for the address family of this connection.
    ///
    /// Policy routing disabled means that NetworkManager will add all routes to the main
    /// table (except static routes that explicitly configure a different table). Additionally,
    /// NetworkManager will not delete any extraneous routes from tables except the main table.
