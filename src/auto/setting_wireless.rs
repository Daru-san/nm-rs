    /// ## Properties

    ///
    /// #### `ap-isolation`
    ///  Configures AP isolation, which prevents communication between
    /// wireless devices connected to this AP. This property can be set
    /// to a value different from [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default] only when the
    /// interface is configured in AP mode.
    ///
    /// If set to [`Ternary::True`][crate::Ternary::True], devices are not able to communicate
    /// with each other. This increases security because it protects
    /// devices against attacks from other clients in the network. At
    /// the same time, it prevents devices to access resources on the
    /// same wireless networks as file shares, printers, etc.
    ///
    /// If set to [`Ternary::False`][crate::Ternary::False], devices can talk to each other.
    ///
    /// When set to [`Ternary::Default`][crate::Ternary::Default], the global default is used; in
    /// case the global default is unspecified it is assumed to be
    /// [`Ternary::False`][crate::Ternary::False].
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `band`
    ///  802.11 frequency band of the network.  One of "a" for 5GHz 802.11a or
    /// "bg" for 2.4GHz 802.11.  This will lock associations to the Wi-Fi network
    /// to the specific band, i.e. if "a" is specified, the device will not
    /// associate with the same network in the 2.4GHz band even if the network's
    /// settings are compatible.  This setting depends on specific driver
    /// capability and may not work with all drivers.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `bssid`
    ///  If specified, directs the device to only associate with the given access
    /// point.  This capability is highly driver dependent and not supported by
    /// all devices.  Note: this property does not control the BSSID used when
    /// creating an Ad-Hoc network and is unlikely to in the future.
    ///
    /// Locking a client profile to a certain BSSID will prevent roaming and also
    /// disable background scanning. That can be useful, if there is only one access
    /// point for the SSID.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `channel`
    ///  Wireless channel to use for the Wi-Fi connection.  The device will only
    /// join (or create for Ad-Hoc networks) a Wi-Fi network on the specified
    /// channel.  Because channel numbers overlap between bands, this property
    /// also requires the "band" property to be set.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `channel-width`
    ///  Specifies width of the wireless channel in Access Point (AP) mode.
    ///
    /// When set to [`SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto`][crate::SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto] (the default), the
    /// channel width is automatically determined. At the moment, this means that
    /// the safest (smallest) width is chosen.
    ///
    /// If the value is not [`SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto`][crate::SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto], then the
    /// 'channel' property must also be set. When using the 2.4GHz band, the width
    /// can be at most 40MHz.
    ///
    /// This property can be set to a value different from
    /// [`SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto`][crate::SettingWirelessChannelWidth::Auto] only when the interface is configured
    /// in AP mode.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `cloned-mac-address`
    ///  If specified, request that the device use this MAC address instead.
    /// This is known as MAC cloning or spoofing.
    ///
    /// Beside explicitly specifying a MAC address, the special values "preserve", "permanent",
    /// "random", "stable" and "stable-ssid" are supported.
    /// "preserve" means not to touch the MAC address on activation.
    /// "permanent" means to use the permanent hardware address of the device.
    /// "random" creates a random MAC address on each connect.
    /// "stable" creates a hashed MAC address based on connection.stable-id and a
    /// machine dependent key.
    /// "stable-ssid" creates a hashed MAC address based on the SSID, the same as setting the
    /// stable-id to "${NETWORK_SSID}".
    ///
    /// If unspecified, the value can be overwritten via global defaults, see manual
    /// of NetworkManager.conf. If still unspecified, it defaults to "preserve"
    /// (older versions of NetworkManager may use a different default value).
    ///
    /// On D-Bus, this field is expressed as "assigned-mac-address" or the deprecated
    /// "cloned-mac-address".
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `generate-mac-address-mask`
    ///  With #NMSettingWireless:cloned-mac-address setting "random" or "stable",
    /// by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally-administered,
    /// unicast MAC address is created. This property allows one to specify that certain bits
    /// are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will
    /// always be unset to create a unicast MAC address.
    ///
    /// If the property is [`None`], it is eligible to be overwritten by a default
    /// connection setting. If the value is still [`None`] or an empty string, the
    /// default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC address.
    ///
    /// If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask. The set
    /// bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device,
    /// while the unset bits are subject to randomization.
    /// Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address
    /// and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm.
    ///
    /// If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask,
    /// this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits
    /// that shall not be randomized. For example, a value of
    /// "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address
    /// to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized. A value of
    /// "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled
    /// globally-administered, burned-in MAC address.
    ///
    /// If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of
    /// them is chosen randomly. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00"
    /// will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally
    /// administered.
    ///
    /// Readable | Writeable
    ///
    ///
    /// #### `hidden`
    ///  If [`true`], indicates that the network is a non-broadcasting network that
    /// hides its SSID. This works both in infrastructure and AP mode.
    ///
    /// In infrastructure mode, various workarounds are used for a more reliable
    /// discovery of hidden networks, such as probe-scanning the SSID.  However,
    /// these workarounds expose inherent insecurities with hidden SSID networks,
    /// and thus hidden SSID networks should be used with caution.
    ///
    /// In AP mode, the created network does not broadcast its SSID.
    ///
    /// Note that marking the network as hidden may be a privacy issue for you
    /// (in infrastructure mode) or client stations (in AP mode), as the explicit
    /// probe-scans are distinctly recognizable on the air.

    /// address of the device (i.e. MAC spoofing).
